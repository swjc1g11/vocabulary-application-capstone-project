# What does this app do?

This app is a simple proof of concept app intended to help me learn vocabulary. It is an app I have long wanted for myself in a very early version and allows you to practice exercises associated with a vocabulary list.

Once you have practiced words in a list enough, you will receive a date at which you should next review those words. This is a date for which you can set a reminder at a particular time.

On receiving on the notification, clicking on the notification will take you directly to the list you need to practice.

On practicing those words again, on or past the review date, you can level those words up.

The maximum level is Level 5. The practice intervals include: 24 hours, 48 hours, 1 week and 2 weeks at this time.

This follows a pedagogical practice known as spaced repetition in a simple way, which aims to help you remember something in the long-term.

Practicing at the specified intervals is a good start to helping you remember something.
